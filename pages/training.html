		<h3>Private Training vs. Group Training</h3>
		<p>Group training would be best for puppies or older dogs that are social with other dogs and people. Group training allow people to watch each other, share their experiences and help one another understand that they often are contending with similar behaviors from their puppies. The owners come to realize that they are not alone. Group classes also teach your dog to pay attention to you even when there are distractions. Private training allows the session to be customized to you and your dogs needs. This is ideal for a dog that needs a quieter environment with fewer distractions. For some dogs it will be ideal to have a private lesson before going to group lessons.</p>
